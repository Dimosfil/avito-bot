## Rule Precedence

- Treat safety, secrets, and destructive-action constraints as highest priority.
- Follow explicit user requests unless they conflict with safety or repository
  rules.
- Let project-local `AGENTS.md`, runbooks, and working agreements override these
  shared reusable rules when they are more specific.
- Use these shared rules when project-local guidance is absent or ambiguous.
- Agents may ask concise clarification questions about implementation details
  and may propose a better-fit solution, workflow, stack, algorithm, or tradeoff
  when it improves the user's stated goal.
- Prefer token economy and optimization after the correct scope is clear.
